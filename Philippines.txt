Thoughts:

Hello, 
And welcome to my ? Survivor Book Report ?.


In this season I finally learned what an “advantage” is. You had tried to explain it to me before and I saw one in season 28, but I needed to see more than one to actually understand. Especially because before I think it was just another immunity idol. 

I enjoyed that people got to come back and get a second chance. A bummer for Russell that he couldn’t get it together, but still. 
As the season kept going, I was like:

“Skupin isn’t going to win this.”

“Laurin isn’t going to make me have watched an entire season of television to have a pedophile win one million dollars.”

“Skupin is still in this game. He can’t be the one who wins this.”

“Is Laurin going to have me watch a pedophile win one million dollars?”

“He’s in the final three. He can’t be the guy.”

“Okay it’s Denise.”

(I thought of this bit and it originally made me want to make a video. That was too much work, but I liked it, so it stays. Also, I tried on my most BDG blazer/jacket in my closet that I haven’t worn in ~a decade and it was much too large to make the video bit work.)
I get what you mean by all of Skupin’s injuries being a sort of karma. Man couldn’t keep himself in one piece for a day. As much as Abi interrupting him at tribal annoyed me, he had the ‘stupid’ comments coming, lol. 

I found myself rooting for a lot of different people throughout the season. Pretty much just as long as Pete and Abi didn’t win. Pete ended up being rude even after the game was over in the after show, so I especially don’t feel bad for rooting against him. Abi at least seemed to understand why people didn’t like her after watching the season. 
I enjoyed Lisa. She seemed to be fairly honest and was the only one I’ve really empathized with, hah. Not great for the game maybe, but I think that would have gotten her my vote for the after-show win $100,000 thing. Her seeing her brother got me too. She was ready to leave up until that point I feel. It was hilarious seeing the before/after photos in the after show of her seeing her brother. Just a completely different person. 
Penner was a very good storyteller. I felt bad when he got kicked off, but he very well may have won so it makes sense. He was definitely more manipulative that he seemed though. Definitely playing games and lying directly to Lisa’s face. His sort of scrambling to stay in the game was much more fun to watch than Tony’s from the other season who was just sort of unpleasant. 
Abi was actively un-fun to watch sometimes. Pretty much anytime someone was trying to talk and she just cut them off multiple times. I think they could have beaten her at the end and that she would have been a good choice to bring; but if I were in their shoes, I absolutely would have voted her off when they did if not sooner. 
Malcolm was good at challenges, but they were really playing him up during the reunion show. He was fine and I was rooting for him, but he didn’t really seem that special. I guess people really liked him if they brought him back so fast though. 

I have a small sample size, since all the modern Survivor I have seen I never made it to the tribal council, but this season seemed like Jeff was just shocked every time they went to council. Season 28 he was more like ‘yeah that makes sense.’ This time it was just like ‘what is going on? what is wrong with these people?’

The auctions seem like a lot of fun. It seems like there would have to be a way to keep the advantage part of it from being such a thing and keep it in the game; but I’m sure the show runners know a lot more than I do. I’m all there for people going all in on random food. 

If whatever the next season I end up watching doesn’t have a tribe that fails every single time, I’m not sure if I’ll know what’s going on. Teams of somewhat evenly matched skill? I don’t understand. 








In conclusion:
There are no thoughts in this man’s head.



Thank you for your time. I will now be accepting questions.
